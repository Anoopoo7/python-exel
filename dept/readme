hi sis..,

1) first cofigure the settings.py file database section, i created the database as 'dpt_table'
   if you  need create your own schema and put it here or create a new database named "dpt_table" as like me :)

2) run 'python manage.py makemigration' and 'python manage.py migrate' as well.

3) uncomment model.save() from views.py (line no.13)

4) delete this file before you submit.
